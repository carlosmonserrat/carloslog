    <h1>Hi!</h1>
    <p>My name is Carlos Monserrat, thanks for the visit. </p>
    <p>You can take a look to my cv in this link <a href="#">The CV</a>. But you can also enjoy some of my thoughts and
      words in the follow section.</p>
    <p>
      In the last couple of years since 2012 I got the chance to work in the software industry and gain some good
      experience in the implementation of web API's using different tools and programming languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Making a career in software engineering was not an easy goal to achieve since most of the educational programs in
      Bolivia were (probably still are in " "datetime.now()") focus in systems engineering, system administration
      and some brief introduction to software engineering (which was not clearly distinguish between whats is now the
      data science career fields and the software management).
    </p>
    <p> In any case my motivations were always in trying the different technologies, explore the web!, connect with the
      world and all the possibilities of being connected to this global network. The first person who introduce me a
      computer and all the possibilities of this device was my Uncle Limbert.
      He is a brilliant man from which I was always feeling inspired since a kid, perfect marks in school, outstanding
      in every field, he started touching the bare metal of this machines as a electronic engineer in his young age and
      later perform a career in telecommunications, business administration until becoming the great
      manager he is right now. </p>

    <p>My grand parents brought to him a computer during his studies, a computer with a blue screen (probably a
      Commodore) and some application called WORK PERFECT to write documents and print them.
      The printer turns to be an ATARI printer (which probably was not the most successful product), this was not that
      interesting in those days but at least it was not so hard for myself as a child
      to adapt to this machine and learn in a short time how to work with it and maintain it, which became a part time
      job from the times my grand parents needed it for something when my uncle was not there.
      One evening my uncle brought to our house a Compaq portable computer with a really nice surprise, a brand new
      video game which everyone was talking about, DOOM!, it was not the first video game I touched since I was already
      dealing with
      the old Atari of my uncles but it was still an interesting concept for me to have so much functionalities in a
      single and portable device!.</p>

    <p>The years pass and my parents realize how important a computer was starting to become for every family, specially
      in school times, they manage to save some money and finally went with me to the store to pick
      what was my first desktop computer, I was 11 years old when this happen and became just the beginning of a great
      way to spent my time.</p>

    <p>In those years I was already starting to introduce myself in the Basic programming language, which was part of
      some computer educational program at school but unfortunately didn't manage to go deeper
      since this education was mostly covering some brief chapters to this topics and not really digging in the theory,
      it was mostly a copy pasting from the teacher's notes in a whiteboard, word by word and carefully
      in order to successfully make an application run and enjoy your good grade, which for me was something easy to
      perform, but the true fun was always starting in the experimentation, finishing the redundant exercise and start
      trying all the different
      possibilities, patterns, operations and multiple ways to solve the exact same problem, which for the teacher could
      become a bad thing to do since it would demand from him to start asking to us some more questions
      and reviewing it more carefully, which for a course of more than 50 students, could take a lot of time, feeling a
      bit rebel was unavoidable since I was feeling I was reaching some success for each new way of solving a problem I
      could encounter, but sometimes I could struggle and just feel frustrated of not avoiding the exact same solution
      as the one written in the boring white board.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal was more or less clear. To finish school and finally start focusing in a way to  understand not just the logic on this thing (which for me was just related to computers),
      the video games, the internet, all the web sites in those days, the beautiful and amazing animations made in flash,  the people who made this things, and the type of
      education they also had when making this products. I was not that easy tough.
    </p>
    <p>   I finish the school and started a career in Environmental Engineering..., not truly related at all with this current
      story, but a good reminder of what it means to follow what you feel is correct
      instead of what others tells you what is better for you, I only study one year of this career to understand that
      this was not going to make me feel comfortable in a future with a working position</p>
    <p>
      It all started in 2012 when finishing the bachelor program in software and systems engineering in La Paz Bolivia,
      the first time I got the chance to work in a web application was for the publication of the first analysis of the
      Political Constitution of Bolivia, with simple architecture and design of the annotations, and bunch of plugins
      for the commentaries and a whole bunch of multiple methods for the proper communication with the database and
      modules created.
      For sure was not something beautiful to debug and work around
      the Scala programming language and frontend
      client side web applications using some of the, at least in the latest years, Javascript frameworks (React, Vue),
      which I would not say is the ultimate set of tools, but it has gave a great opportunity to introduce myself in the
      implementation of some of the latest
      web application architectures, such as microservices.
